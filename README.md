# Emotion Classification using Logistic Regression

This project aims to build an emotion classification system using a logistic regression model. The model predicts emotions (like joy, sadness, anger, etc.) based on input text. The project involves text preprocessing, model training, saving the model using joblib, and providing a prediction system for new inputs.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict emotions from text. Using machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, we process text data, train a classifier, and make predictions on the emotions of the input text.

### Key Steps in the Project:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for model training by removing special characters and stopwords.
2. **Model Training**: Using Logistic Regression to classify emotions.
3. **Model Saving**: Saving the trained model using `joblib` for future use.
4. **Prediction System**: Making predictions based on new, unseen text inputs.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
